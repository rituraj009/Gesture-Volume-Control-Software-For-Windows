# OpenCV-Project
Gesture Volume Control Software For Windows

## Description  
1) In this project I have build a gesture volume control system which will allows us  to control the volume of the computer by just using two fingers.  
2) This software captures your webcam input, detects focal points on your hand like the fingertips and joints and allows us to find the distance between two points.  
3) To build this app we use opencv's python module which allows us to capture video from our web cam, frame-by-frame.  
  
### NOTE



4) Once the video is captured then MediaPipe is used which provides us a set of already trained machine learning models which allows us to detect hands in a live video. 
5) Then detecting the key points on our hands to detect a gesture and find the distance between tips of two fingers so that we could control system volume.
